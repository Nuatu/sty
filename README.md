## Overview

Sty is a set of handy command line tools meant to help with day-to-day
work with AWS. Sty is working on Mac and Linux using Bash or Zsh. 

## Installation

Sty is written in Ruby so you need to ensure it installed beforehand.
Most modern Linux and Mac versions should have Ruby pre-installed. In
any case, it is recommended to use Ruby version manager such as
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

To install Sty run:
`gem install sty`

During installation, Sty creates it executable `/usr/local/bin/sty`.
This installation step require sudo on Linux.

Sty also creates `.sty` directory in your home folder. This is a place
where all configuration files are located.

## Functions

- Authenticate to AWS account, cache credentials
- Open browser console for the current session (Mac only)
- SSH to instances, incluging using jumphost
- Start SSM session to instances (require SSM plugin installed) 
- Switch command line proxy settings

## Configuration

All config files live in `~/.sty`

## Uninstallation

`gem uninstall sty` 
`sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/sty` 
`rm -rf ~/.sty`

## Caveats

- Credentials are stored in plain unencrypted files
- Opening of a browser console is not working on Linux

## TODO 

- [ ] Create test coverage 
- [ ] Use keychain on Mac to encrypt stored credentials
- [ ] Fix all issues on Linux
